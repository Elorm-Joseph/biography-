        <h4>Who is Mark Zuckerberg?</h4>
        <p>
          Mark Elliot Zuckerberg is an internet entrepreneur and philanthropist
          from America. He co-founded Facebook and serves as its current
          chairman and chief executive officer. A New York native, Zuckerberg
          studied psychology and computer science at Harvard University. During
          this period, he and his college roommates, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew
          McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, launched Facebook from
          their dormitory. Initially meant to be for select college campuses,
          the site witnessed exponential growth in the following few years and
          became the world's biggest social media platform. As of the third
          quarter of 2018, Facebook had amassed over 2.27 billion monthly active
          users. Zuckerberg has also been involved with several other projects,
          including Wirehog, a file-sharing program, and Internet.org, a
          conglomerate of several companies attempting to bring affordable
          access to selected internet services in less developed countries. Over
          the course of his professional career, Zuckerberg has encountered a
          number of legal controversies.

        <h4>His Metaverse Project</h4>
        <p>
          The metaverse could help with the company's demographic crisis, if it
          encourages young people to strap on their Oculus headsets and hang out
          in Horizon — Facebook's social V.R. app — instead of watching TikTok
          videos on their phones. Another problem Facebook's metaverse strategy
          could address, if it works, is platform risk. For years, Mr.
          Zuckerberg has been irked that because Facebook's mobile apps run on
          iOS and Android, its success is highly dependent on Apple and Google,
          two companies whose priorities are often diametrically opposed to its
          own. This year's “app tracking transparency” changes by Apple, for
          example, dealt a blow to Facebook's advertising business by making it
          harder for the company to collect data about users' mobile activity.
          And if smartphones remain the dominant way that people interact
          online, Facebook will never truly control its own destiny.

        <h4>Early life and education</h4>
        <p>
          Mark Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York,
          and was raised in nearby Dobbs Ferry. He was born into a well-educated
          family and developed an interest in computer programming at an early
          age. At the age of 12, Zuckerberg created a messaging program named
          Zucknet that he implemented as an inter-office communication system
          for his father's dental practice. Due to his early signs of success,
          his parents got him a computer programming tutor while he was still in
          high school, and they enrolled him in at Phillips Exeter Academy, a
          prep school in New Hampshire. After graduating from prep school,
          Zuckerberg enrolled at Harvard University.
        </p>
        <h4>His success story</h4>
        <p>
          While many intelligent people attend Harvard University, Mark
          Zuckerberg became known quickly as the go-to computer programmer on
          campus. By his sophomore year, he had already built two programs:
          CourseMatch and FaceMash. Both programs became wildly popular, but the
          university shut down the latter program after it was deemed to be
          inappropriate.
