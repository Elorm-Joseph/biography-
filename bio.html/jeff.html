        <h4>Who is Jeff Bezos?</h4>
        <p>
            Jeff Bezos is an entrepreneur and e-commerce pioneer  and the founder and CEO
          of the e-commerce company Amazon, owner of The Washington Post and
          founder of the space exploration company Blue Origin. His successful
          business ventures have made him one of the richest people in the
          world. Born in 1964 in New Mexico, Bezos had an early love of
          computers and studied computer science and electrical engineering at
          Princeton University. After graduation, he worked on Wall Street, and
          in 1990 he became the youngest senior vice president at the investment
          firm D.E. Shaw. Four years later, Bezos quit his lucrative job to open
          Amazon.com, an online bookstore that became one of the Internet's
          biggest success stories. In 2013, Bezos purchased The Washington Post,
          and in 2017 Amazon acquired Whole Foods. In February 2021, Amazon
          announced that Bezos will step down as CEO in the third quarter of the
          year.
        </p>
        <h4>Early life and education</h4>
        <p>
          Bezos was born on January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to a
          teenage mother, Jacklyn Gise Jorgensen, and his biological father, Ted
          Jorgensen. The Jorgensens were married less than a year. When Bezos
          was 4 years old, his mother remarried Mike Bezos, a Cuban immigrant.
          Bezos graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University in 1986 with
          a degree in computer science and electrical engineering. Bezos showed
          an early interest in how things work, turning his parents' garage into
          a laboratory and rigging electrical contraptions around his house as a
          child. He moved to Miami with his family as a teenager, where he
          developed a love for computers and graduated valedictorian of his high
          school. It was during high school that he started his first business,
          the Dream Institute, an educational summer camp for fourth, fifth and
          sixth graders.

        <h4>His Amazon Project</h4>
        <p>
          The determination that went into accomplishing this dream is
          momentous. Amazon came into existence through ceaseless and constant
          quest for building a quality organization. Amazon was built on the
          pillars of strength of character, single minded focus and a will to
          provide the highest consumer experience to every person associated
          with the company. Jeff Bezos went onto to build a web retailing system
          while the world was still wondering how an internet can function. The
          key focus for Amazon has never been to defeat competitors. Rather it
          focuses on helping consumers and building a value for them. This keeps
          them engrossed in implementing their plans and policies.
